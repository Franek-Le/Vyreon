# The Vyreon Programming Language

## The Vyreon Programming Language is a programming language that compiles to bytecode and runs on the Vyreon Virtual Machine

### The Programming Language is statically typed, easy and fast

I made this programming language because i needed an easy language that has static types, but i probably could have used Typescript.
